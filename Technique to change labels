#Technique to change labels. 

#The text will change after you select the first entry field and then unfocus it by
#selecting the next field

#Necessary import to use tkinter:
from tkinter import *

#Building the window:
window=Tk()

#The title on the bar of the window:
window.title("Technique to change labels")

#A function that will be used to change the text of the label:
def change():
    Label1.config(text="Changed!")

#Label to be changed:
Label1=Label(window,text="This text will change")
Label1.grid(row=0,column=0)

#When focus is taken off of this entry field, it will run the function to
#change the text in the label:
entry1 = Entry(window, validate="focusout", validatecommand=change)
entry1.grid(row=1,column=0)

#This second entry field simply gives us something else to focus on, and
#take focus off of the first entry field.
entry2 = Entry(window)
entry2.grid(row=2,column=0,pady=10)

#The end of the program:
window.mainloop()
